# Eval-gated AI action surface (FR-2.4; ARCH §5.2/§6) — /ai/enrollment/draft,
# /proposals/{id}/decision, /proposals. The decision route is the sole state
# write (INV-2); every proposal + eval + decision is logged (NFR-6).
app.include_router(ai_actions_router)

# Per-family notes timeline (FR-2.3; A-8) — /families/{id}/notes GET + POST.
# Manual notes + deterministic state-change auto-notes; no LLM, no proposals.
app.include_router(notes_router)

# "Seed to HubSpot" deterministic write-action (S10 W3; ARCH §7.1; INV-2/9) —
# /enrollment/families/{id}/seed POST. Pushes a synthetic family across the
# CRMAdapter seam (live writes a Contact+Deal into the real portal behind the
# four guards; simulate records). The deal id returned is the captured live id.
app.include_router(enrollment_router)

# Funding view + GT-controlled signal advance (FR-2.7; ARCH §6, §5.4) —
# /families/{id}/funding GET + /families/{id}/funding/signal POST. Deterministic
# TEFA math + the §5.4 funding-state machine; the signal is GT-controlled (INV-10),
# never an Odyssey API.
app.include_router(funding_router)

# Supabase↔HubSpot seam (FR-1.3/2.6; ARCH §4.7/§6) — /seam GET +
# /seam/{id}/reconcile POST. The reconcile is human-gated and LOGGED (NFR-6); a
# flagged conflict fails closed (INV-4).
app.include_router(seam_router)

# CRM seam status (S14 W4; INV-3/INV-8 surfaced) — /crm/status GET. A read-only
# window onto the effective HubSpot seam (configured CRM_MODE, the kill switch, the
# mode the registry would actually select, whether a token is set — NEVER the token,
# the per-run call cap). The frontend reads it to show "CRM: Simulated/LIVE/Kill
# switch ON" and to FAIL CLOSED — disable the live-push control when the kill switch
# is on (the INV-3 "red eval disables the action in the UI" pattern). The kill
# switch's MECHANISM stays the server env var; this only surfaces state.
app.include_router(crm_status_router)

# Content engine (FR-3.1/3.4/3.5; ARCH §5.3) — /ai/content/generate (gated batch),
# /content/{id}/decision (the sole content state write — keep promotes library +
# brand memory, discard strengthens a dont signal), /content/library (kept+
# validated search). Nothing publishes without an explicit keep (INV-2/INV-3).

# GEO tracking (FR-3.7/4.4; ARCH §5.5/§6) — /geo GET (coverage vs the 0% baseline
# + lift, a deterministic default pass) + /geo/sample POST (a fresh repeated-
# sampling run, logged to the audit spine, NFR-6). Sampling is offline/simulated
# (INV-9); insufficient samples fail closed and disable the action (INV-3).
