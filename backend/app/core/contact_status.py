"""Contact-recency deriver — the PURE color-system core (S9 W1).

The enrollment cockpit color-codes every family by *how stale our contact is*:
a brand-new uncontacted lead is grey (fresh), one we have let sit too long is
red (overdue), one we have followed up on is light-green, and a won family is
neutral (closed). This module derives that :class:`ContactStatus` deterministically.

Recency is DERIVED, not stored (ASSUMPTIONS A-14): a family's ``last_contact_at``
comes from the append-only audit log (``core/contact_log.py``), and this deriver
consumes it alongside the family's ``created_at`` and an injected ``now``. Per
CLAUDE.md §3 / INV-2 this is deterministic core: it is a pure function of its
arguments — no I/O, no ``datetime.now`` (``now`` is injected), no
``anthropic``/``app.ai``/``app.adapters``. Same inputs ⇒ same status.

The day thresholds live in ``params.enrollment.contact`` (INV-11), never
hardcoded: ``grey_window_days`` bounds the fresh region and ``overdue_days`` is
the red threshold. The 4th-day rule (with the committed ``overdue_days=4``): an
uncontacted family at age 3 is still FRESH, at age 4 it is OVERDUE.
